3 chosen data structures:
1. LLRB BST - Huang
2. Scapegoat Tree - Hezekias


coding the data structures:
Do not import any library other than timeit, random, string and matplotlib.
assume the elements in the set to be strings; 
you must implement (and evaluate) both search and insert operations, but there is no need to support a delete operation.
